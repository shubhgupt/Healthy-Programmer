# Healthy-Programmer
its Name is Describing its purpose, and I am using it on daily basis.
I have created this one for myself using python.
This project notifies the user after every 26 mins to drink water, 30 mins to relax your eyes and after every 45 mins to stand up from your chair and do some physical exercise. Basically it notifies with music so its pretty relaxing too, I really love this one.
Pygame module is used for playing music and time module to keep track of time.
It also saves your activity in a text file so that if you want you can check it later.
